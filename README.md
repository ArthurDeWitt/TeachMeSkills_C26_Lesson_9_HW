# Homework1
Finish the problem from homework #5.
Multiplication of two matrices
Create two arrays of integers of size 3x3 (two matrices).
Write a programme to multiply the two matrices.
The first array: {{1,0,0,0},{0,1,0,0},{0,0,0,0}}
Second array: {{1,2,3},{1,1,1},{0,0,0},{2,1,0}}
Expected result: 1 2 3 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
Create the Utils class.
In this class create a static method to display the matrix on the screen using System.out.println.
The method should accept a two-dimensional array as input and return nothing as output.
Use this static method in the class to solve the matrix multiplication problem.
Use this static method to print a matrix to the screen three times - output the first matrix, output the second matrix, output the result.
# Homework2
Create a programme to transfer from one customer's bank card to another customer's card.
The data for the transfer is set from the console.
There is a client.
The system stores information about the client's name, surname, passport number, date of birth.
As well as his postcode, country, city, street and house number.
The client can have a bank card (one or more).
Make a method to transfer the amount from one krata to another.
Each card contains card number, CVC/CVV, current amount on the card, card code(id).
Cards can be of three types: BelCard, MasterCard, VisaCard.
There are limits for transfers. Limits are checked only for the card from which the transfer is made.
There are different limits for each type of card.
Cards can be in different currencies - therefore, provide for conversion.
A commission is charged for the transfer (set as a percentage).
Provide for various checks and validations.
Scenario for validation:
From the console enter the code(id) of the card with.... (e.g. 1)
The console enters the code(2) of a card with... (for example, 2). (e.g. 2)
the console is used to enter the transfer amount.
The programme outputs the following message:
Customer's First-First Name
Number of client's cards
Card 1 - amount before transfer
Card 1 - amount after transfer
Card 2 - amount before transfer
Card 2 - amount after transfer
Transfer fee.
